For my Deep Learning project in year 2 semester 2, i was tasked with the following: 

1. Build a CNN model which is able to successfully classify three classes of images - "Airplane", "Automobile" & "Truck".
2. I was also tasked with building a CNN model and a transfer learning model, where i have to justify and explain which Classification Model method is better. 

Here is the walkthrough of what you can find in the ipynb: 
1. ESRGAN utilised from official tensorflow documentation, where it is used to improve the quality of the images as the dataset received from my instituition was blurry.
2. Built CNN model, including advanced features such as attention makes and concatenated pooling to make the architecture more robust than ever.
3. Trained three diffferent transfer learning models - Inception, MobileNetV3 Small & DenseNet, utilising similar architectures for every model.


The justifications, along with the code for the architecture of the models can be found in the notebook in the repository!
